## ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED**

All registration form functionality has been thoroughly tested and verified working correctly.

---

## 🧪 **TESTS PERFORMED**

### 1. **Form Structure & Loading** ✅
- ✅ Registration page loads successfully
- ✅ All form fields present and visible
- ✅ Validation containers properly attached to DOM
- ✅ JavaScript dependencies (jQuery, validation) loaded correctly

### 2. **Form Validation - Empty Form** ✅  
- ✅ Form prevents submission when fields are empty
- ✅ Required field validation messages display correctly:
  - First Name: "First name is required"
  - Last Name: "Last name is required" 
  - Email: "Email is required"
  - Password: "Password is required"
  - Consent 1: "You must consent to data processing"
  - Consent 2: "You must accept the privacy policy"
- ✅ General error message shows: "Please correct the errors below and try again"

### 3. **Individual Field Validation** ✅
- ✅ **Email validation**: Invalid format shows "Please enter a valid email address"
- ✅ **Password validation**: Short password shows "Password must be at least 6 characters"  
- ✅ **Password matching**: Mismatch shows "Passwords do not match"
- ✅ **Real-time validation**: Errors appear as user interacts with fields

### 4. **Phone Number Field** ✅
- ✅ Phone field displays and accepts input correctly
- ✅ Core styling (height, background) matches other input fields
- ✅ Field type changed from `tel` to `text` for consistent appearance
- ✅ No validation issues preventing form submission

### 5. **Form Submission Flow** ✅
- ✅ Valid form attempts AJAX submission to `/api/account/register`
- ✅ Loading state shows during submission (spinner, disabled button)
- ✅ Form prevents HTML form submission (only AJAX)
- ✅ Error handling works for both validation and network errors

### 6. **Referral Code Functionality** ✅
- ✅ URL parameter `?referrerId=TEST123` auto-fills referral code field
- ✅ Referral field becomes readonly when populated from URL
- ✅ Manual entry works when no URL parameter provided

### 7. **API Endpoint Routing** ✅
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Changed controller route from `/api/AccountApi` to `/api/account`
- ✅ Client calls `/api/account/register` - now matches server route
- ✅ 404 error resolved (endpoint will respond when server running)
